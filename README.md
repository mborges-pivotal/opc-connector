# OPC Connector
The purpose of this project is to provide connectivity to machines (broadly speaking) via the OPC standard. The initial OPC standard was restricted to the Windows platform (OLE for Process Control), but since has evolved to support an more universal approach (OPC UA - Unified Architecture)

See [What is OPC](https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/)

## Building

** Note: ** We have a *dependency* folder with a package of libraries and script to install on your local maven repository. However, this since has been replace by remote repository. Still, I'm concern about the evolution, or lack of it, of the open-scada and its ancillary projects - e.g. Utgard
